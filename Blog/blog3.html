                </h3>
                <p>Everyone was happy to see a sport return after a prolonged absence, and it appears tennis has emerged from its covid-19 sabbatical stronger than ever. Tennis has benefited greatly by being one of the first few sports to be given permission to reopen, despite the absence of Tennis action on our courts and screens. Tennis is being ranked as one of the modern sports with the highest COVID security. Therefore, for those who are just starting out in tennis and may be seeking some advice before unlocking their inner player on the court. Maidan's came up with the concept to list some shots you can at least try to play in your first tennis match.  
                </p>

             
                <h5>The Serve:
                </h5>
                <p>First and foremost, a serve is necessary for the game to start. The Player receives most crucial shot in tennis to make sure to nail it or expect a challenging return from your opponent. Each point must begin with a serve from one player. The most popular method for doing this is with an overhead serve; it may be best to start off with an underarm serve to prevent dropped balls and double faults. The serve has been perfected in the professional game to 'serve' as the winning stroke right from the bat termed as an 'ace'. The majority of professionals serve the ball at a speed of about 100 mph while using different topspin or sidespin. 
                </p>
                <h5>The lob shot: 
                </h5>
                <p>
                  Another stroke in the book that keeps onlookers entertained is the lob shot. In a typical rally, the lob shot hardly ever occurs. But when it does, you're guaranteed to be on the edge of your seat. But it's a different scenario for your adversary. It is never an easy chore to see the ball go right above and then have to dash frantically to the backline to rescue the point and some honor. If their volleys don't go in, a player who loves playing near to the goal might anticipate being lobbed a few times during the game.
  
                </p>
                <h5>Circus shot: 
                </h5>
                <p>It appears that there is a variety of techniques for professionals to repeatedly get the ball over the net. Every year, tennis professionals add more apparently absurd new smashes to their armory. Notably, the drop shot has developed into a move that is frequently employed by both professional and amateur players and requires for a delicate touch. The "Tweener" shot is one that never ceases to astound.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This move is typically utilized when a player finds oneself sprinting back after receiving a lob and smacks the ball between their own legs. The shot first surfaced in the 1970s, but it has lately gained popularity as a recovery attempt that never seems to work.
 
                </p>
                <h5>Forehand shot: 
                </h5>
                <p>
                  The "forehand" is the shot used the most frequently in tennis. Basically, a player strikes the ball with the palm of their dominant hand facing the ball. Although the backhand is perhaps the simplest stroke for newbies to learn, some players, often those who are more experienced with cricket, baseball, or hockey, prefer to play the backhand. The forehand stroke is possibly the simplest to execute and has the potential to be the most potent weapon in a tennis player's arsenal. Eastern, Western, and Continental are the three basic divisions of forehand grips. The angle at which the racquet strikes the ball when it collides is the key distinction between them all.
                </p>
                <h5>
                  Backhand shot: 

                </h5>
                <p>The backhand stroke is frequently the one that distinguishes decent tennis players from great ones and is usually regarded as the toughest shot in the book to learn as a tennis player. The backhand shot is executed from the player's non-dominant side, with the hand facing the ball and the racquet pointed away from the body. When playing a backhand stroke, many players, including professionals and amateurs, frequently use two hands to add extra force to the swing. Some of the top backhand players in tennis history are Roger Federer, Serena Williams, and Andre Agassi. When used properly, the backhand may also be a terrific technique to provide the ball backspin.
                </p>
                <h5>
                  The volley:

                </h5>
                <p>The volley is probably one of the most visually appealing tennis strokes, especially when played in front of an audience at center court. The volley is typically utilized closer to the net to produce greater force and, ideally, win the point. It can be shot in the air before the ball has rebounded. Used forehand or backhand, the volley is an effective weapon to put your opponent on the back foot. But once you make a decision, there's no turning back!
                </p>
                <h5>
                  Half volley: 

                </h5>
                <p>In similar circumstances to when a volley would be hit—either as you approach the net or when you are at the net—players can hit a half volley with either their forehand or backhand.
                </p>
                <p>A half volley is essentially a shot where you can't reach to the ball quickly enough to volley it and don't have enough time to execute a full groundstroke. You allow the ball to bounce as a consequence, then swiftly block or divert it back to the other side of the court.
                </p>
                <p>Most of the time, it is best to strike a groundstroke after the ball bounces or a volley while it is still in the air.</p>
