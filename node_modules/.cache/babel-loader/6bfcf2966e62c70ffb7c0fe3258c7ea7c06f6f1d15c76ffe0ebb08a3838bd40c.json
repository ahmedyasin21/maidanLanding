would be incomplete\n                    without sports. Outdoor games, whether with family or\n                    friends, provide a way for \"kids to play with other kids,\n                    neighbors to gather, and adult hangouts.\"\n                  </p>\n                 \n                  <h5>1. Paddle racquet</h5>\n                  <p>\n                    A tried-and-true game that is similar to tennis (a different\n                    type of outdoor game). It's \"super simple to throw in your\n                    bag and go.\" Every summer, it sells faster. This portable\n                    game does not require a net, making it ideal for train\n                    rides, and it can accommodate as many players as you have\n                    racquets for. Gameplay can be as easy as striking the ball\n                    back and forth, which is beneficial for children developing\n                    hand-eye coordination. A scoring system can be introduced in\n                    which players or teams receive one point for each hit, with\n                    the game beginning once the ball hits the ground.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    \"It's a game that we always have tucked into our beach bag,\"\n                    says Kate Salop, co-owner of Tisbury Toy Box on Martha's\n                    Vineyard. Our family enjoys competitive — and mainly\n                    amicable! — games. We started playing when the kids were\n                    little, and they still like it now that they are teenagers.\"\n                  </p>\n                  <h5>2: Spikeball:</h5>\n                  <p>\n                    Spikeball is similar to volleyball but a different type of\n                    outdoor game, except that instead of striking the ball over\n                    a net, you bounce it off of one. To play, you'll need four\n                    players divided into two teams of two, with the goal of\n                    bouncing the ball off the net in such a way that the\n                    opposing team can't bounce it back.\n                  </p>\n\n                 \n                  <h5>3. Soccer Bowling: </h5>\n                  <h5>\n                    You will need: A soccer ball and plastic bottles filled with\n                    water.\n                  </h5>\n                  <p>\n                    Play this game on the grass or as a field day activity. It's\n                    also a great activity for a child's birthday celebration.\n                  </p>\n\n                  <p>\n                    Set the water-filled plastic bottles at a specific distance\n                    away from the players. Arrange the bottles but keep in mind\n                    that the game is most enjoyable when all of the bottles can\n                    be knocked over with one kick.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    Allow each player to play one at a time, and give each\n                    player three chances to kick the football at the bottles.\n                    The goal is to bring down as many as possible. Players\n                    shouldn’t reset the bottles in the middle of the kicks. A\n                    player receives one point for each bottle that is turned\n                    over.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    The player with the most points at the end of the game wins\n                    in it.\n                  </p>\n                  <h5>4. Maranda Ladderball Pro Steel Game:</h5>\n                  <p>\n                    If you can't get enough tossing games, we propose\n                    Ladderball, a different type of outdoor game and point-based\n                    game that can be played in bigger groups. The set includes\n                    two plastic pipe ladders as well as a piece of rope with a\n                    ball on each end that you throw to catch onto the pipes from\n                    a distance. Hitting the top of the ladder earns the player\n                    three points, while hitting the middle bar earns two points\n                    and hitting the bottom bar earns one point. The player who\n                    scores 21 points first wins. The game is popular among\n                    summer campers and would also appeal to families.\n                  </p>\n\n                  <h4>5. Footgolf:</h4>\n                  <p>This game is best enjoyed in the backyard or garden.</p>\n                  <p>\n                    The purpose of the game is to kick a football at objectives.\n                    For instance, hitting a specific tree or rock or having the\n                    ball halt in a specified zone.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    If you have a lot of area to play then footgolf is best\n                    among different types og games, you can play with golf-style\n                    rules, where each participant gets one point for each kick\n                    and the player with the fewest points wins.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    If you play in your backyard, you can challenge your\n                    opponents to hit a target three times. They gain one point\n                    if they hit once. They gain 3 points if they hit all three\n                    times.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    Then you can switch to a different target and let everyone\n                    play again.\n                  </p>\n                  <h5>Suggested targets are:</h5>\n                  <ul>\n                    <li>A flagpole. </li>\n                    <li>A swimming pool.</li>\n                    <li>A tree.</li>\n                    <li>Hit a garage door.</li>\n                  </ul>\n                  <h5>6. Food on a String Game</h5>\n                  <p>\n                    You will need: A long string to hang candies and donuts\n                    from. This is a particularly delicious eating competition in\n                    which contestants consume sweets dangling from threads with\n                    only their mouths. Hands are not allowed. The player who\n                    eats the most sweets in one minute wins! If you're throwing\n                    a kids' party, this is a terrific outdoor game to play.\n                  </p>\n                  <h5>How to Create a Playing Area?</h5>\n                  <p>\n                    As it is a different type of outdoor game, to begin, tie the\n                    candy or fruit to shorter pieces of string, which are then\n                    tied to a longer thread. Then, tie the long string somewhere\n                    in the playing area, such as between two trees.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    This game can be played indoors. Just make sure you don't\n                    attach the string to something that will fall over when the\n                    sharks get to the candy.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    The Kind of Candy to Hang Up Try to choose a candy size that\n                    is appropriate for the participants. Smaller candies are\n                    appropriate for younger children, whereas larger candy may\n                    be appropriate for adults. Eating should be enjoyable,\n                    simple, and delicious!\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    Marshmallows and donuts are popular treats in this area.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    <b>Tip:</b> To make things easier, get candies with holes in\n                    them because they are incredibly easy to hang up.\n                  </p>\n                  <h5>7. Egg and Spoon Race:</h5>\n                  <p>Each player will need a spoon and an egg.</p>\n\n                  <p>\n                    This is quite a different type of outdoor game suitable for\n                    both children and adults. Play it outside as a fun Easter\n                    game, at birthday celebrations, or any other gathering. This\n                    game is very enjoyable for children.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    Give each participant a spoon and place the handle in their\n                    mouths. They must balance an egg on a spoon while running a\n                    course quickly. The fastest runner takes first place.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    No one may touch their egg or spoon with their hands during\n                    the tournament. If the egg is dropped but does not crack,\n                    the player can pick it up and begin again. However, if it\n                    does crack, the player is out of the game. This might be as\n                    basic as sprinting something, or it can be as complex as you\n                    like. The tournament is won by the team that finishes first.\n                  </p>\n                  <h5>8. Disc Golf:</h5>\n                  <p>\n                    Disc golf is a fun activity to play with your family and\n                    friends. Because you'll need some space, this is a great\n                    outdoor game to play on your lawn, garden or field.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    The game may be simply adapted to the skill level of the\n                    participants. Points can be awarded, for example, if a goal\n                    is scored, or the highest point awarded to the player who\n                    comes closest, followed by a one-point decline in order of\n                    how the other players threw the disc.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    The aim may be anything you choose. Land in a swimming pool,\n                    get trapped in a specific bush, strike a swing or tree, or\n                    land in a specific spot, for example.\n                  </p>\n                  <h5>Here are two strategies for playing the game.</h5>\n                  <h5>Version 1 - Achieving One Goal at a Time</h5>\n                  <p>\n                    Participants in this version of disc golf navigate between\n                    different objectives, much like in real golf. After everyone\n                    has completed their throws, you calculate their scores and\n                    go to the next course.\n                  </p>\n                  <h5>Version 2 - Throws with the Fewest</h5>\n                  <p>\n                    You have a long path here that requires at least three\n                    throws to reach the target. The player with the fewest\n                    throws wins the game.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    Meidan also helps you find your favorite playground in\n                    Lahore and select time-slot availability.
