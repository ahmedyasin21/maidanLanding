Food on a String Game</h5>\n                  <p>\n                    You will need: A long string to hang candies and donuts\n                    from. This is a particularly delicious eating competition in\n                    which contestants consume sweets dangling from threads with\n                    only their mouths. Hands are not allowed. The player who\n                    eats the most sweets in one minute wins! If you're throwing\n                    a kids' party, this is a terrific outdoor game to play.\n                  </p>\n                  <h5>How to Create a Playing Area?</h5>\n                  <p>\n                    As it is a different type of outdoor game, to begin, tie the\n                    candy or fruit to shorter pieces of string, which are then\n                    tied to a longer thread. Then, tie the long string somewhere\n                    in the playing area, such as between two trees.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    This game can be played indoors. Just make sure you don't\n                    attach the string to something that will fall over when the\n                    sharks get to the candy.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    The Kind of Candy to Hang Up Try to choose a candy size that\n                    is appropriate for the participants. Smaller candies are\n                    appropriate for younger children, whereas larger candy may\n                    be appropriate for adults. Eating should be enjoyable,\n                    simple, and delicious!\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    Marshmallows and donuts are popular treats in this area.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    <b>Tip:</b> To make things easier, get candies with holes in\n                    them because they are incredibly easy to hang up.\n                  </p>\n                  <h5>7. Egg and Spoon Race:</h5>\n                  <p>Each player will need a spoon and an egg.</p>\n\n                  <p>\n                    This is quite a different type of outdoor game suitable for\n                    both children and adults. Play it outside as a fun Easter\n                    game, at birthday celebrations, or any other gathering. This\n                    game is very enjoyable for children.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    Give each participant a spoon and place the handle in their\n                    mouths. They must balance an egg on a spoon while running a\n                    course quickly. The fastest runner takes first place.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    No one may touch their egg or spoon with their hands during\n                    the tournament. If the egg is dropped but does not crack,\n                    the player can pick it up and begin again. However, if it\n                    does crack, the player is out of the game. This might be as\n                    basic as sprinting something, or it can be as complex as you\n                    like. The tournament is won by the team that finishes first.\n                  </p>\n                  <h5>8. Disc Golf:</h5>\n                  <p>\n                    Disc golf is a fun activity to play with your family and\n                    friends. Because you'll need some space, this is a great\n                    outdoor game to play on your lawn, garden or field.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    The game may be simply adapted to the skill level of the\n                    participants. Points can be awarded, for example, if a goal\n                    is scored, or the highest point awarded to the player who\n                    comes closest, followed by a one-point decline in order of\n                    how the other players threw the disc.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    The aim may be anything you choose. Land in a swimming pool,\n                    get trapped in a specific bush, strike a swing or tree, or\n                    land in a specific spot, for example.\n                  </p>\n                  <h5>Here are two strategies for playing the game.</h5>\n                  <h5>Version 1 - Achieving One Goal at a Time</h5>\n                  <p>\n                    Participants in this version of disc golf navigate between\n                    different objectives, much like in real golf. After everyone\n                    has completed their throws, you calculate their scores and\n                    go to the next course.\n                  </p>\n                  <h5>Version 2 - Throws with the Fewest</h5>\n                  <p>\n                    You have a long path here that requires at least three\n                    throws to reach the target. The player with the fewest\n                    throws wins the game.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    Meidan also helps you find your favorite playground in\n                    Lahore and select time-slot availability.
