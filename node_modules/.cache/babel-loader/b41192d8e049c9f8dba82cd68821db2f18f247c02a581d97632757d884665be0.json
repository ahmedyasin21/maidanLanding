Everyone else should stand in a circle\n                    around the circle of chairs, with one person serving as the\n                    designated music player. When the music begins, circle the\n                    seats; when the music stops, everyone needs to find a seat.\n                    Anyone who doesn't is removed. Continue until two people are\n                    vying for one seat, then remove one more chair and start\n                    over.
