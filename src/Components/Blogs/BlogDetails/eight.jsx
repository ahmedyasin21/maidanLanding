                    while blindfolded.

                  </ul>
                  <h5>2. Human Snakes: </h5>
                  <p>
                    When there are more than 10 players, the indoor game for
                    adults Human Snakes is really enjoyable. You must divide the
                    group into equal-sized teams in order to play. Although
                    teams can be arranged anyway you desire, we advise you to
                    keep the number of members per team at four to six.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Have everyone line up with their hands on the shoulders of
                    the person in front of them after your teams have been
                    divided. Except for the person at the back of the line,
                    everyone in the queue has their blindfolds on. The object of
                    the game is to move through an obstacle course as the person
                    at the end of the line's human snake.

                  </p>
                  <h5>3. Camera hot potato:</h5>
                  <p>

                    that can be handed around the group for this simple game.
                  </p>
                  <h5>What you should do is:</h5>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      For 10 seconds, set the phone's camera to self-timer mode.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Make sure to switch out the selfie mode for standard photo
                      mode.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Each player only holds the phone long enough to strike a
                      pose for the camera as they pass the camera back and
                      forth.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                      It's time to go through the pictures after the camera
                      completes its circuit of the circle. The images will
                      probably be quite obscene but amusing nonetheless.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <h4>4. Office scavenger hunt:</h4>
                  <p>

                    the game, which lasts about 30 minutes. If you're searching
                    for a game that is quick-paced, competitive, and different,

                  </p>
                  <h5>Gameplay:</h5>

                    Make sure these are things you can find at the office. Give
                    the players a particular amount of time to look for each
                    object. The round is won by the first individual to return
                    with each item. Office scavenger hunts are also wonderful
                    since, depending on your demands, the game can last for two
                    rounds or five.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    You need look no deeper than Mr. Freeze for a group activity
                    that effectively promotes mindfulness skills. The game

                    person keeps wandering around the office. However, everyone
                    else must stop when Mr. Freeze does. After Mr. Freeze stops,
                    anyone who moves is eliminated. Play continues until each
                    player is eliminated.
                  </p>
                  <h5>Would you rather…?</h5>
                  <p>
                    Create a circle. Would you rather... questions should be
                    asked to the someone next to you, along with two difficult
                    scenarios. (Example: "Would you rather not take a shower for
                    a year or not brush your teeth for a year?") Their chance to
                    ask the person next to them after their response. Continue
                    until you run out of scenarios to consider.
                  </p>
                  <h5>6. Two truths and One lie:</h5>
                  <p>
                    Choose three facts about yourself, such as "I have two
                    siblings, I've visited three continents, and I love cats."
                    One should be false and two should be true. Then the next
                    person goes, and everyone else has to guess which is the
                    lie. This is a fantastic icebreaker game; if you play with
                    family or friends, choose ambiguous information to deceive
                    one another for added fun.
                  </p>
                  <h5>Musical Chair:</h5>
                  <p>
                    Although it's a prevalent party game for youngsters, adults
                    can also participate. Set out enough chairs (cushions) in a
                    circle so that everyone who will be participating can sit
                    there, minus one. Everyone else should stand in a circle
                    around the circle of chairs, with one person serving as the
                    designated music player. When the music begins, circle the
                    seats; when the music stops, everyone needs to find a seat.
                    Anyone who doesn't is removed. Continue until two people are
                    vying for one seat, then remove one more chair and start
                    over. Create your own rules for musical chairs to make it
                    more engaging. Make your own changes, such as allowing
                    people to sit on top of each other as long as their feet are
                    not touching the ground.
