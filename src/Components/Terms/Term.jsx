              <p>
                You agree to pay the applicable fees as shown on the Meidan Site
                and/or Application and are in control of any payments or fees
                associated with your account if you make a reservation using the

                Prices may occasionally change on the Meidan website and/or
                application. Meidan will never automatically add extra fees to a
                booking's pricing; instead, it will only do so for services that
                the User has consciously and freely chosen.
              </p>
              <p>
                Meidan reserves the right to deduct a portion of the cash as a
                commission for the provided service in the event that a booked
                activity is cancelled.
